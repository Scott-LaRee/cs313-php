   <h1>How the movie ruins the story</h1>
   <p>I believe the problems with the movie start when they try to make it
   not a Cinderella story. I feel that the genius of Ella Enchanted is how
   it takes to basic outline of Cinderella and makes it new again. It looses
   some of its charm if you try to take that away.

	<h3>Major Changes<h3>
	<h4>Ella's Curse doesn't follow the laws of physics</h4>
	<p>In the movie there is a part where someone shouts at her to freeze
	just as she leaps into the air. This causes her to freeze mid-air. This
	is ridiculous and not at all how it would have happened in the book. In
	believe this was an attempt to make the movie more visually interesting,
	but it is just stupid.</p>
	<h4>Prince Char's family</h4>
	<p>In the book Prince Char's parents are alive and well. In the movie,
	they were murdered by an uncle, who shouldn't exist. This uncle then
	steals the throne from Prince Char and plots ways to kill him. His grand
	plan upon finding out about Ella's curse is to have her put a poisoned 
	crown on Prince Char's head. This crown emits a smokey green aura and
	looks completely stupid.</p>
	<h4>Mandy</h4>
	<p>In the book Mandy is a fairy who looks middle aged and works as a cook
	in Ella's home. She refuses to do big magic, which is pretty much anything 
	that could make a difference in your life. In the movie she's a twenty 
	something twit who accidentally turned her boyfriend into a talking book 
	because she's terrible at magic and can't get anything right.</p>
	<h4>Excessively Political</h4>
	<p>In the book the elves have their own society. They live in the forest and
	have many craftsman. A lot of attention is given to a potter named Agulien, 
	who makes beautiful pieces that Sir Peter is always trying to get his hands on.
	In the movie they are subjugated by the government and forced to work as
	entertainers.</p>
	<p>In the book the Ogres are monsters who can persuade people to 
	obey them with their honey sweet words. They trap people who are traveling so
	that they can eat them. In the movie they are harmless, albeit ugly, creatures
	who don't want to harm anyone but have gotten a bad name because Prince Char's
	uncle framed them for killing the king.</p>
	<p>These changes are really annoying because they seem so pointless. What purpose
	does it serve, really?</p>
	<h4>The Mall Opening</h4>
	<p>In the movie Ella meets Prince Char at a mall opening where he is present
	as a local celebrity. There are shops and a second story, complete with wooden
	escalator. This scene irritates me a great deal. A wooden escalator? Really?</p>
    <h4>How Ella Breaks the Curse</h4>
	<p>Of all of the changes made in the movie, this one is the most agregious. In
	the book it takes a great deal of inner strength for Ella to break the curse.
	Prince Char has just asked her to marry him. Ella loves him desperately, but she
	knows that if she marries him he will be in danger. Her step family already know
	about her curse and she is certain others will figure it out. There are just too
	many eyes at court. The only way to protect him and the kingdom is to stay away
	from him. Because of this she wants to refuse to marry him. Before she can say it
	her step mother commands her to marry him. She wants to take advantage of the 
	power she could have from having Ella in a position where she can control her to
	her own advantage. Ella knows this and refuses to agree. She begins to feel ill
	from not obeying. She fights within herself. Obey, refuse, obey refuse. Back and 
	forth until she reaches the one inexcapeable truth deep within herself, she loves
	Char and MUST protect him. This truth is more powerful than anything else, even the
	curse. She shouts NO that she won't marry the prince. Then she realizes that the
	curse is broken and changes her mind.</p>
	<p>In the movie she is walking towards Prince Char holding the green smokey crown
	to place it on his head. She then looks in a mirror behind him and says to herself,
	"You will no longer be obedient!" That's it. That's all it took. SOOO lame.</p>
